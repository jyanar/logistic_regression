Implemented function that groups trials into NGROUPS (for example, trials with
-30 to -20 evidence, -19 to -10, etc). 
	TODO: probably best to make it such that the inside group (-6, 6)
	is the only one with inclusive boundaries? All other groups are
	inclusive on the number away from center, but exclusive for one
	towards center. idk.
