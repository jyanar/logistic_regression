- Need to make it such that we can fit logistic regression to either to the
beginning of the stimulus or the end of the stimulus presentation.

# 2020-01-14
- Figured out how to fit a logistic regression using the GLM.jl package to the
simulated data from NEU314. Now to fit to Chuck's data!

- Want to learn GLM stuff today so I can start implementing it.
    - Monday: Learn GLM stuff, start implementing it and getting data read in.
    - Tuesday: Get data read in, implementing GLM.
    - Wednesday: Have general function for fitting logit model to rats.
    - Thursday: Inspect fits to multiple rats.
    - Friday: Continue inspecting.
    - Tuesday (next week): Be fitting to multiple datasets.

- Going to use GLM.jl to build the logistic regression analysis. bdata works,
  (you just have to be connected to the Princeton VPN), and I have the frozen
  noise data from Chuck.

  It has the following fields (opening up an _ALL.mat file)
  - vh: Violation history
  - hh: hit history, violated trials show up as NaNs
  - pd: Garbage (duration of stimulus, but messed up?)
  - sd: Stimulus duration
  - sh: Stimulator history, for opto.
  - seed: Seed used to generate the trial
  - is_frozen: If it's a frozen trial
  - parsed: struct, contains previous data but cleaned of violated trials.
    Containsthe following fields:
        - bd: Bup difference at the end of the trial
        - gr: Whether the rat went right (1, went right, 0, went left)
        - b: Clicktimes
            - right: Clicktimes [s] for right
            - left:  Clicktimes [s] for left
        - g: gamma (log ratio of left and right click rates). Pos gamma means
          rightward trial, neg gamma means left trial. Larger absolute gamma,
          easier trial. Note that a trial's gamma was how Brodylab used to
          reward trials. However, at low magnitude gamma this means that even
          if the gamma is positive, you can end up generating a trial with more
          left clicks. Holdover from the random dot motion task, in which the
          monkeys are sorta trying to estimate the generative process itself.
          Chuck says that somewhere between 1 - 4% of trials are wrong.
        - hh: Hit history, again (1 = correct, 0 = incorrect answer)
        - pd: Duration of stimulus. This is the amount of time that clicks were
          allowed to occur within. Ranges from 200 to 1000 ms. Note that the
          trial itself is 1.5 seconds long, and the stimulus window is anchored
          to the end of the trial. Thus, rats know to stop accumulating at 1.5
          seconds, regardless of when the stimulus starts.

Implemented function that groups trials into NGROUPS (for example, trials with
-30 to -20 evidence, -19 to -10, etc). 
	TODO: probably best to make it such that the inside group (-6, 6)
	is the only one with inclusive boundaries? All other groups are
	inclusive on the number away from center, but exclusive for one
	towards center. idk.
